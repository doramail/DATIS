# Troubleshooting

## I cannot hear the ATIS station

Possible causes:
- You are on the wrong frequency.
- You have "Line of Sight" in your SRS activated but no LOS to the ATIS station.
- You have "Distance Limit" in your SRS activated but are too far away from the ATIS station.
- You are testing a mission in singleplayer (incl. via the mission editor) and have "Secure Coalition Radios" activated. The stations will work with "Secure Coalition Radios" enabeld in multiplayer, but not in singleplayer.
- The station is not running, check the client list of your SRS server and make sure that you see the ATIS station in the list. If not, check the DATIS logs.
